## Usage

# dsa-practical

There are 3 ways to run and test these ``javascript`` files.

#### Method 1 (not preferred, but you can ðŸ–•)

copy the code which you want to run, open any online ``javascript`` interpreter paste it and run.

#### Method 2 (you can give it a try ðŸ™‚)

create a ``html`` file inside that file create a ``<script/>`` tag and give reference to ``.js`` file which you want to run. Open that file in your browser... now you can see the output in your browser's console.

#### Method 3 (the only preferred way on planet earth ðŸ˜Ž)

install ``NodeJs`` on your machine. Open your terminal (cmd) and type this command- ``node /path/to/file.js``

### Interesting things to try

Make some changes in the code and observe the output.
